Repeatedly run `cd` and `ls`?  Use `pk` instead!

### Shouldn't you use ls?

Peek gives you interactive exploration of directories on the command line.  It will list all the files in your working directory and allow you to interact with them.  You can open directories to change working directories, edit text files, and even request your desktop environment to open a file.

### Shouldn't you use a file manager?

Short answer: *Probably not.*  
Long answer:  *Definitely not:*  
Peek aids your current workflow as-is rather than being an interruption.  It quickly displays the info you need and allows you to act upon it.  
On the other hand, a file manager would fill your screen with information.  It assumes the only thing you want to do is manage your files (move, copy, delete), and expects you to use it until you are done interacting with your files.
